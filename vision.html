				<h2>My Vision</h2>
				<p>My vision is that more and more children and teenagers grow into confident, self-assured adolescents who have the courage to become the success that they envision themselves to be. By attaining self-esteem, resilience, self-awareness and
					developing a positive healthy self-image and identity children and teenagers will be able to tackle any difficulties life has to throw at them and not lose sight of their goals.</p>

				<h2>Resume</h2>
				<p>Maria Marczynski has a successful career in coaching as well as teaching children and teenagers starting from primary school up to adolescents who are studying at university. Through coaching Maria found the real purpose of her life, the
					practice of Empowerment Coaching and through the journey of self-development and self-realization she gained such valuable knowledge on the tools and mind-set needed so as to have what we all strive for: happiness, abundance, power.
					Today she is successfully dedicated to youngsters and to the practice of Empowerment Coaching and through her personal experiences, background and empathy helps the young generation to uncover their true potential and create the life they truly
					desire and deserve.

				<h2>About Maria</h2>
				<blockquote cite="#">
					I started out working in various different branches of the business sector and it was a few years later when I finally became who I was supposed to be. Someone who has unconditional love and untold empathy for the young generation. I went into
					teaching English and through this journey I discovered a talent that I had aside from teaching the pure subject of English. I acquired a unique relationship with each student offered them support, boosted their confidence and was able to help
					them through times that were stressful. A close friend of mine introduced me to the effectiveness of coaching and this pushed my personal life as well as my career to a different level.
					Empowerment Coaching has and is helping me raise my two boys and all the youth that I am honoured to work with to address their social and emotional well-being. Through coaching I was able to give so much more and on a much larger scale. Today
					I am able to support the younger generation with action orientated, practical, and future focused skills that will stay with them throughout their lifetime. The daily practice of Empowerment Coaching promotes my skills such as positivity,
					strength, authenticity, determination, creation, humour, and patience. Taking into account my thoughts, emotions and empathy that I have towards others I am able to connect to the younger generation which creates a chemistry that is empowering.
					By being able to understand them as well as accept their perspective I assist in the wonderful journey of witnessing them discover who they are and how to achieve their goals. I do not believe that our life is created by chance. I strongly
					believe that we have the potential and power to create our own life every single moment, based on the quality of our thoughts and emotions. The revelation of personal growth is truly magical and it is up to us to define how much we will be
					enlightened.
