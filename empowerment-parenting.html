				<h2>Coaching and Parenting</h2>
				<p>I think all parents can agree that raising children is no easy task. The challenges for families of all shapes and sizes appear to be growing and with the added financial and time pressure placed on parents and carers it is literally
					non-stop!
					The Empowerment Coaching model is similar to the role of a parent: coaching and relationships are built on trust, mutual respect, openness, support and empathy. A coach’s mission is to support clients in the successful reach of their goals,
					bearing witness to their personal development and growth as they create life-affirming changes. A parent’s mission is similar- to see their child grow and develop personally, social;;y, academically and emotionally, and for children to realize
					their potential while living a happy and fulfilled life.
					No parent could want less for their children than to be happy and healthy and to feel rewarded in their pursuits, career and home life. The parallels between coach and parent are numerous: coaches support, challenge, educate, motivate,
					encourage and hopefully bear witness to their clients’ personal growth, just as most parents strive to do. Parents will often act in the role of coach to their children and by taking the next step by using the coaching tools they can build
					happy, confident and self-aware children, while parents feel more aware of their child’s needs and better equipped to tackle problems and raise well-balanced, optimistic children.
