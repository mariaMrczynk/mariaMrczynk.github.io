				<h2>What is Life Coaching?</h2>
				<p>The most successful people in the world work with a coach and the reason is that Life Coaching works!</p>
				<p>Life Coaching is a dynamic personal development process, through which you achieve your personal and professional goals, based on your values, preferences and unique perspective. It is very practical and effective and produces measurable and
					sustainable results. It helps people to bridge the gap between where they are now and where they want to be. The coaching practice is addressed to mentally healthy people.</p>
				<p>
					By focusing not on what your life was, only what can be and eventually what is, you can create the life you choose. It is a profession profoundly different from consulting, mentoring, therapy or counselling, because it focuses on the future and
					all answers come from the client. Life Coaching engages the Socratic Method, a series of questions formulated to help you discover your beliefs and to guide you in finding your own solutions, based on the principle that “Each of us, is wiser
					for himself”.</p>
				<p>Coaching brings out your own unlimited potential and also connects your inner purpose and passion to outer goals and tasks to bring about extraordinary and sustainable results. Your coach will cooperate with you to design the life of your
					dreams.

				<h2>Why Coach Children, Teenagers and Adolescents?</h2>
				<p>Many children growing up in the world today are richer than any generation before.  They have access to more information than the world’s largest library at their fingertips, and are typically better educated than their parents or grandparents.  So arguably, children who are a part of these wealthy nations should be the happiest, healthiest and most successful on Earth.  However we hear of numerous stories of youth bullying, depression, suicide, disaffection and the list goes on.  Growing up has never seemed harder.</p>
				<p>The problems affecting children and young people are largely universal.  There is a clear need to address children’s well-being both in and outside of school, and to build the social and emotional intelligence of young people alongside their academic ability.  This will help the young generation to become more resilient, positive in the face of adversity, and most importantly, equipped with the necessary tool to cope and find support when issues and life events occur that threaten well-being.</p>
				<p>Life coaching builds skills and awareness, helping children and young people to understand themselves better, identify issues of concern or goals they wish to reach, and develop methods for managing their emotions and improving their life situation.  As a result they improve their social and emotional well-being and create a more positive outlook and outcome.</p>
